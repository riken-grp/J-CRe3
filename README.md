# J-CRe3: Japanese Conversation dataset for Real-world Reference Resolution

![Dataset Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riken-grp/J-CRe3/main/docs/overview.pdf)

## Overview

J-CRe3 is a real-world Japanese conversation dataset that contains egocentric video and dialogue audio of real-world conversations between two people.
The conversations involve a robot that is helping its master with daily mundane tasks, including many object manipulations.
It contains 93 scenario-based dialogues with 2,131 utterances and 11,024 seconds of video.
As shown in the figure above, the dataset is annotated with the following information:

- Bounding boxes

- Textual references

- Text-to-object references

## Distributed Files

- `textual_annotation/`: Processed transcriptions of the dialogue audio with textual reference annotations. The files in this directory are in [the KNP format](https://rhoknp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format/index.html#knp), which can be easily parsed by [rhoknp](https://github.com/ku-nlp/rhoknp).

- `id/`: Scenario ID files providing train/valid/test split.

- `visual_annotations/`: Visual annotations of the bounding boxes and text-to-object references in the video. The files in this directory are in JSON format whose schema is described below.

- `raw_annotation/`: Bounding box and text-to-object reference annotations. The files in this directory are directly generated by the annotation tool, and most of the annotations are omitted for efficient annotation. Refer to the files under the `visual_annotations` directory for processed complete annotations.

- `transcription/`: Transcription of the dialogue audio. This directory contains files directly generated by the transcription tool (ELAN). Refer to the files under the `textual_annotations` directory for processed transcriptions.
